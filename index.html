            Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
          </li>
          <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
          <li>
            Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth
            and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
            immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention
            and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.

        <button class="accordion">How likely am I to catch COVID-19?</button>
        <article class="panel">
          <p>
            The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding
            there.

            For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now
            places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or
            visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are
            taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
            restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce
            your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

            COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other
            countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Itâ€™s important to be aware of the situation
            where you are or intend to go.

        <button class="accordion">Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?</button>
        <article class="panel">
          <p>
            Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.
            However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be
            hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.

        <button class="accordion">Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19</button>
        <article class="panel">
          <p>
            While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19,
            there is NO evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease.
          </p>
        </article>

        <button class="accordion">Should I wear a mask to protect myself?</button>
        <article class="panel">
          <p>
            Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who
            may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone
            who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to
            use masks wisely.

        <button class="accordion">Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?</button>
        <article class="panel">
          <p>
            Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected
            with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet
            cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet
            been confirmed.

            To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and
            surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or
            animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked
            animal products.

        <button class="accordion">How did the first human SARS-CoV-2 infections occur?</button>
        <article class="panel">
          <p>
            The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. At this stage, it
            is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected with SARS-CoV-2.

            However, SARS-CoV, the virus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, jumped from an animal reservoir
            (civet cats, a farmed wild animal) to humans and then spread between humans. In a similar way, it is
            thought that SARS-CoV-2 jumped the species barrier and initially infected humans, but more likely through
            an intermediate host, that is another animal species more likely to be handled by humans - this could be a
            domestic animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has not been identified.

            Until the source of this virus is identified and controlled, there is a risk of reintroduction of the
            virus in the human population and the risk of new outbreaks like the ones we are currently experiencing.
