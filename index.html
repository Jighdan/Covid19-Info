                <p>To understand what COVID-19 is we must define what a coronavirus is first; coronaviruses are a large
                    family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are
                    known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as
                    Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).</p>
                <p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus
                    and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>

            <h1 class="section-titular">How does it spread?</h1>
            <section class="section-content">
                <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to
                    person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                    coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then
                    catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
                    People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs
                    out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
                    person who is sick.</p>

            <h1 class="section-titular">What are the Symptoms</h1>
            <section class="section-content">
                <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have
                    aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually
                    mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel
                    unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1
                    out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
                    Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                    diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty
                    breathing should seek medical attention.</p>
                <p>While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with
                    pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or
                    diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others. </p>

                        and water.</li>
                    <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or

                    <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering
                        your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the
                        used tissue immediately.</li>
                    <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
                        attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.</li>
